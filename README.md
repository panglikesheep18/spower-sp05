# spower-sp05

## This files are not there yet because i had to cleanup the files before uploading and apparently it is improving fast. 

spower sp05 is the first flagship power bank created by panglikesheep18, it features detachable battery and an external XT30 connector (stock) for powering hobby charger, the battery uses 4 cells with BMS on it.

the battery can be charged by hobby charger allowing fast(er) charging <!--or be used for connecting hobby chargers directly without the body-->, the battery (pack) defaults 4 cell 5500mAh batteries connected in series with a BMS attached, and can be shrinked down to 5000mAh each or increased to 6000mAh each natively <!--idk why but it is all because i bought the cells in wrong capacity thinking that it had the same dimensions as previous but got it so wrong the pack enclousure had to be redesigned-->.

<!-- Stock (mine) has 2 USB-A outputs with 12V-18W max. using only one port, 20V-60W max. on USB-C input / output port using only this port and a Micro-USB input connector with 12V-18W max. -->
