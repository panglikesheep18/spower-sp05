<!--panglikesheep18 made the case, the rest are from others-->
spower sp05 is the first flagship power bank created by panglikesheep18, it features detachable battery and an external XT30 connector (stock) for powering hobby charger, the battery uses 4 cells with BMS on it.

the battery can be charged by a hobby charger allowing fast(er) charging <!--or be used for connecting hobby chargers directly without the body-->, the battery (pack) defaults 4 cell 5500mAh batteries connected in series with a BMS attached, and can be shrinked down to 5000mAh each or increased to 6000mAh each natively <!--idk why but it is all because i bought the cells in wrong capacity thinking that it had the same dimensions as previous but got it so wrong the pack enclousure had to be redesigned-->.

# Building sp05

### Warning: the project you want to make contains lithium polymer battery, which will explode <!-- mostly --> with or <!--rarely--> without user interaction (i.e. heating the pads for too long, bending, puncturing or crushing during assembly, short circuit on internal circuit or through external inputs or overloading the battery), I (panglikesheep18) <!--[[We]]--> don't have responsibility for causing explosion due to user errors, please be certin with building one. Building your own at your own risk!!

## File key
Print them in PETG or ABS if the file doesn't start with anything special

Print them in transparent (natural) PETG filament if the file starts with [t]   <!-- for "old-version/v1" print them in PETG-->

Print them in TPU95A if the file starts with [s]    <!--(unless you want to risk connectors touching contacts or don't add the connector)-->

#### Do not print anything with PLA, unless you want the power bank to melt during use.

## Print configurations

Recommended print configuration is 0.2mm layer height, 1mm wall thickness, 1mm top thickness, 1mm bottom thickness (1mm top / bottom thickness), 40% infill percentage (infills higher than 40% have no major durability improvments), any infill type is OK, no slicer supports are required, PETG, ABS, and TPU95A for xt30cover is recommended.

<!-- Stock (mine) has 2 USB-A outputs with 12V-18W max. using only one port, 20V-60W max. on USB-C input / output port using only this port and a Micro-USB input connector with 12V-18W max. -->

<!-- History (is this BS?)
    on late 2020 i got an idea of making a higher-end power bank called spower sp05, i didn't search the parts until May 2021
    May 2021: my idea of making a higher power power bank got so bad i ordered the parts, it originally used 2500mah but because discharge power were too low so i switched to 5500mah for safe side.
    at the same month, 7 days later i started sketching it in CAD
    i was planning to add a slot that use magnets (even pogo pins) and XT30 but because of health concern and usability issue i only use XT30s on it
    also 7 days later (16 May) parts were printed and the unit was assembled. i hope i was the speedrunner of the flagships and sp05 v1 was born.
    i actually don't use it very much until in August that i took it because i had to take photos with some characters and when my device were deplated i had to use it to charge multiple devices, at this time timy power banks were non-existant for me (until spower sp06) and so i had to take sp05.
    
  due to usability and potentially durability issue i started upgrading it to v2 in November, thanks to my new printers and new materials and my better thought of this power bank.
  this is also the first time i had revailed spower sp05 to public and guards allowed it.
  
  on December, still v2, i took it again, i revailed sp05 again and guards allowed it too while the other one played it too serious, i had played sp05 safe i didn't put anything useless on it.

  on 2022, i started thinking about upgrading it to v3 and v4, v3 is skipped in the public because it's too minor.

  with v4, improvments were made over v1 with
  tighter tolerance to prevent wobbling, better and more duarable battery mounting, better body assembly, better duarability and easier battery swapping
    
  spower sp05 is so useful i started prefer using it over newly-made spower sp06.
  and i could make it better in the future
